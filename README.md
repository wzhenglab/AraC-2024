# AraC-2024

This repository contains the code used for the MD simulations of the phase seperation of IDR-AraC systems. `openfree` contains the module used for OPENMM simulation. `LLPS_long_IDR` contains the necessary files to run the simulation for IDR-only systems. Similarly, `LLPS_long_dimer` and `LLPS_long_lamnda` include the necessary files to run the simulations for IDR-AraC systems with tunable dimerization strenght and AraC hydrophobicity strenght respectively.
