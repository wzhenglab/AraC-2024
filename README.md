`openfree` contains the module used for OPENMM simulation. 

`LLPS_long_IDR` contains the necessary files to run the simulation for IDR-only systems. 

Similarly, `LLPS_long_dimer` and `LLPS_long_lamnda` include the necessary files to run the simulations for IDR-AraC systems with tunable dimerization strenght and AraC hydrophobicity strenght respectively.

`Flory-Huggins_Model` contains the necessary files to run the numerical solution for Flory-Higgins Model.
